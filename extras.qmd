While we think you can get really far in R with just **data.table** and 
**fixest**, of course these two packages don't cover everything.

This page covers a small list of packages you may find especially useful when 
getting started with R. We won't try to cover everything under the sun here. 
Just a few places to get going. For the rest, well, that's what StackOverflow
or your favourite search engine is for.

All of the below packages have far more applications than is shown here. We'll 
just provide one or two examples of how each can be used. Finally, don't forget 
to install them with `install.packages('PKGNAME')` and load them with 
`library(PKGNAME)`. The former command you only have to run once per package (or 
as often as you want to update it); the latter whenever you want to use a 
package in a new R session.
